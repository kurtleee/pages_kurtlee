###  In the process of making my website, I've come across a lot of barricades. The most important part of making a personal blog, in my view, is to read the official document carefully. Jekyll, for instance, is one of the recent projects I've been working with.

### **- After doing this project, I've learned something new as follow:**

----
1.  **Always** read the **official document** first.
         If you are not familiar with the language you are reading, find the Chinese version of this document or, on the other hand, one-click to translate this page into Chinese.

1. You'll come across a lot of difficulties or problems that you haven't seen before, **Don't PANIC**.
         Use google properly. Don't be afraid of searching on the Internet. If you don't solve the problem, it will always be with you.

1. 3.  Use Youtube videos properly. 
         A lot of videos are out there on YouTube. What you need to do is choose the one you like, and continue to learn from them.
